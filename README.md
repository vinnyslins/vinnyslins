### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with experience and contributions in large-scale projects across various business contexts, building and maintaining resilient, scalable, and highly available services.

Currently, I specialize in backend development primarily using Node.js. Additionally, I am exploring other efficient languages such as Go, Rust, and strictly functional languages.

Furthermore, I have experience in the entire software development lifecycle, from defining architecture and infrastructure to providing support with monitoring and observability.
